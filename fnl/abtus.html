            <p>Bonjour! Welcome to our dear pastry shop, the pastry shop of the stars. We are called the Pâtisserie des Étoiles. This shop is the realization of our team's dream back in the pastry school. We are very happy to serve you the best pastries that will surely make you feel like you are on Cloud 9 along with the stars.</p>

      <p> Our pastry shop was inspired from the vintage French pastry shops as their shop emanates heavenly aroma, authenticity and old-fashioned atmosphere. French pastries are on a whole another level so these became our specialty in order to build our dear shop. We also use the combination of state-of-the-art and vintage baking apparatus to serve you the best quality pastries with the touch of ol' times.</p>
